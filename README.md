# Short Introduction to Bootstrap
Introduction to Bootstrap, written for class "agile web development using python"

I used all the Bootstrap Tools and HTML to create a less conventional style of report, instead of a word or latex document, thus showing the tools in action, for the reader to interact with and examine.

Be aware that it's written in German, though.
